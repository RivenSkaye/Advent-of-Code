# Advent of Code 2022
The first year for this repository, I'm gonna start in Rust like last year, but I won't make the same mistakes.
This year, I want to do at least 2 days in Rust, 2 days in PHP, 2 days in C#, 2 days in Python and I lowkey want to try to play with Haskell as well.

## Personal Challenge
I'll consider this year's personal challenge to use Rust, PHP, C# and Python each to solve one full day. That will mean I've overcome both last year's obstacle of forcing myself to use but a single language, and I'll have gotten further than I did last year.  
Considering I can make it, I'll expand the challenge to use them all twice and hit my goal.

Regarding Haskell, I'll try and backtrack to solve a previous challenge in it I guess, which will be the third challenge for myself. And who knows, maybe I can even solve a day in it instead of redoing one!
