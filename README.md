# Advent-of-Code
### Welcome to my new and improved Advent of Code repository!

# Main goal
This is gonna showcase whatever I write for the AoC from year to year. That means it's gonna have some real crapware hacky code.
That said, I do plan to keep it around this time. Especially considering it'd be a good motivator to last for more than 3 days.  
Before 2021 I didn't keep the code around and I didn't join any boards. I talked about it, but was afraid of being judged.
Then in 2022 I joined some friends, who already knew I write terrible code and thus were happy to help me learn some Rust whilst doing the AoC.
_That's a bad idea kids._ Picking up a lang you have no experience in whatsoever will mean you're in for a world of pain.

# _This time_?
Yes, last year I tried to force myself to do it all in Rust, which wasn't a success. So I dropped out early on.  
That said, it was a good learning experience. It forced me to think differently and it's opened me up to trying new things. And to being a bit more
relaxed in what I want to do.

# Personal challenges
I wanna set some challenges for myself every year. Not because the AoC isn't challenging, but because I think it's a great method of improving
oneself. Especially if you don't mind stepping out of your comfort zone a bit, so I'll set personal challenges without forcing myself through them.
And naturally, I'll track those personal challenges in the per-year READMEs to prevent flooding this file.

# Let the games begin!
